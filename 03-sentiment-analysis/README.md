Sentiment Analysis Using a Recurrent Neural Network
===================================================

The programs in here do a sentiment analysis of text (movie reviews) using
a Recurrent Neural Network. They can either use pre-trained embeddings or not.
For the plots below Facebook's [FastText embeddings][1] were used. Udacity movie
review [dataset][2] was used for training. The example comments in here were
taken from IMDB.
